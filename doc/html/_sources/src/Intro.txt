==========
Motivation
==========

This provides cmake modules that can be re-used by boost and other dependencies. It provides modules to reduce the boilerplate for installing, setting up package config, and creating tests.

=====
Usage
=====

The modules can be installed using standard cmake install::

    mkdir build
    cmake ..
    cmake --build . --target install

Once installed, the modules can be used by using `find_package`::

    find_package(BCM)
    include(BCMBoostPackage)
